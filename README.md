I decided to compare Charlie Cristâ€™s voting patterns to several other democrats and republicans in the state of Florida. 
I thought it would be interesting to see if there were patterns in the voting styles of republicans and democrats and also if Charlie Crist would fit the profile of a democrat voting pattern or a republican voting pattern considering Charlie Crist used to be a republican but is now recently a democrat. 
It turns out that republicans predominantly vote Yes roughly 200-240 times and vote No roughly 80-90 times while democrats vote No just about as often as they vote Yes(split roughly 150 to 150). Also, even though Charlie Crist used to be a republican, his voting patterns mirror a democrat perfectly.
